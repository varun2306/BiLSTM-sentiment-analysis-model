# BiLSTM-sentiment-analysis-model
This project focuses on building a BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) model for sentiment analysis, capable of classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral, and transforming negative sentiments into positive, human-readable text. The system uses advanced NLP techniques and threading for faster execution.
